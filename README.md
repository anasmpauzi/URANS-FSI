# URANS-FSI
This repository contains the URANSâ€“FSI framework developed to predict axial flow-induced vibration (FIV) of a cantilevered structure in turbulent axial flow. The approach demonstrates accurate coupling between fluid and structural solvers for high-stiffness configurations typical of nuclear and structural applications.
