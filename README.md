# URANS‚ÄìFSI: Axial Flow-Induced Vibrations

This repository contains the **URANS‚ÄìFSI framework** developed during my PhD at the **University of Manchester** to predict both root-mean-square (RMS) amplitude and mode frequencies of **axial flow-induced vibration (FIV)** of a blunt-ended cantilevered rod in turbulent axial flow.  
The coupled **unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier‚ÄìStokes (URANS)** and strong **fluid‚Äìstructure interaction (FSI)** methodology is designed for high-stiffness structures typically found in nuclear and energy applications.
